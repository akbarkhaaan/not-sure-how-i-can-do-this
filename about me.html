<h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
<p>Hi, this is small project I'm working on to refine my coding skills. The goal of this project is to practise everything 
I learned and put it to use. I'll try working on this every day, keeping you updated by sending you an email when you
wake up. You dont have to open them everyday, cause that would be annoying, so whenever you're bored check your email.
Not sure what else to write here but I love you.</p>
